      Behold, my anti-IRV copypasta:

      ---

      Ranked choice AKA instant runoff voting AKA the arrogantly branded "the alternative vote" is *not* a good thing.

      ---

      Changing your ranking for a candidate to a *higher* one can *hurt* that candidate. Changing to a *lower* ranking can *help* that candidate. ***IRV fails the monotonicity criterion.***

      ---

      Changing from *not voting at all* to voting *for your favorite* candidates can *hurt* those candidates, causing your least favorite to win. ***IRV fails the participation criterion.***

      ---

      If candidate A is beating candidate B, adding some candidate C can *cause B to win*. ***IRV fails the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion.*** In other words, ***it does not eliminate the spoiler effect.***

      ---

      There are strategic incentives to vote dishonestly.

      Due to the way it works, *it does not and has not helped third parties.*

      Votes cannot be processed locally; Auditing is a nightmare.

      Et cetera.

      If you want a very good and simple single-winner election, look to **approval voting** (AV).


      If you're interested in making that even better in some ways, look to modifications **[delegable yes/no (DYN)](https://www.rangevoting.org/DynDefn.html)** and **[simple optionally-delegated approval (SODA)](https://electowiki.org/wiki/SODA_voting_(Simple_Optionally-Delegated_Approval\))** voting.


      For a couple more interesting single-winner methods, check out **[delegated 3-2-1](https://electowiki.org/wiki/3-2-1_voting)** and Simmons-style **[asset](https://www.rangevoting.org/Asset.html)** voting.

      Enacting IRV is a way to *fake* meaningful voting reform, and build change fatigue, so that folks won't want to change the system yet again.

      > How can a change from not voting at all, to voting for favored candidates, hurt those candidates?

      # Participation Criterion Failure

      [Wikipedia offers a simple example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_criterion#Instant-runoff_voting) of IRV violating the participation criterion, like this:

      ---

      2 voters are unsure whether to vote. 13 voters definitely vote, as follows:

      - 6 rank `C`, `A`, `B`
      - 4 rank `B`, `C`, `A`
      - 3 rank `A`, `B`, `C`

      If the 2 unsure voters don't vote, then `B` wins.

      `A` is eliminated first in this case, for having the fewest top-rank ballots.

      ---

      The unsure voters both would rank `A`, `B`, `C`.

      If they do vote, then `B` gets eliminated first, and `C` wins.

      ---

      By voting, those unsure voters changed the winner from their second choice to their last choice, due to the elimination method which is not as rational as first appears.

      # Monotonicity Criterion Failure

      [Wikipedia offers a less simple example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_criterion#Instant-runoff_voting_and_the_two-round_system_are_not_monotonic) of IRV violating the monotonicity criterion:

      ---

      100 voters go to the booths planning to rank as follows:

      - 30 rank `A`, `B`, `C`
      - 28 rank `C`, `B`, `A`
      - 16 rank `B`, `A`, `C`
      - 16 rank `B`, `C`, `A`
      - 5 rank `A`, `C`, `B`
      - 5 rank `C`, `A`, `B`

      If this happens, `B` gets eliminated, and `A` wins.

      ---

      While in line, 2 folks who planned to rank `C`, `A`, `B` realize they actually prefer `A`.
      They move `A` to the top: `A`, `C`, `B`.

      Now `C` gets eliminated, and `B` wins.

      ---

      By promoting `A` from second to first choice,
      those 2 voters changed the winner from `A`, their favorite, to `B`, their least favorite.
